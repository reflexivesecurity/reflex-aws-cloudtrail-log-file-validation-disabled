# reflex-aws-cloudtrail-log-file-validation-disabled
A Reflex rule to detect the disabling of log file validation for a CloudTrail trail.

To learn more about CloudTrail log file validation, see [the AWS Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-log-file-validation-intro.html).

## Getting Started
To get started using Reflex, check out [the Reflex Documentation](https://docs.cloudmitigator.com/).

## Usage
To use this rule either add it to your `reflex.yaml` configuration file:  
```
rules:
  aws:
    - cloudtrail-log-file-validation-disabled:
        version: latest
```

or add it directly to your Terraform:  
```
module "cloudtrail-log-file-validation-disabled" {
  source            = "git::https://github.com/cloudmitigator/reflex-aws-cloudtrail-log-file-validation-disabled.git?ref=latest"
  sns_topic_arn     = module.central-sns-topic.arn
  reflex_kms_key_id = module.reflex-kms-key.key_id
}
```

Note: The `sns_topic_arn` and `reflex_kms_key_id` example values shown here assume you generated resources with `reflex build`. If you are using the Terraform on its own you need to provide your own valid values.
